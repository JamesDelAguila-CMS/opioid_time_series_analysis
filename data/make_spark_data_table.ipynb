diet program to help you lose weight. It is used by certain overweight people, such as those who are obese or have weight-related medical problems. Losing weight and keeping it off can lessen the many health risks that come with obesity, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a shorter life. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse.

Losing weight and keeping it off can lessen the many health risks that come with obesity, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a shorter life. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse.

It is used by certain overweight people, such as those who are obese or have weight-related medical problems. Losing weight and keeping it off can lessen the many health risks that come with obesity, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a shorter life. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse.

It is used by certain overweight people, such as those who are obese or have weight-related medical problems. Losing weight and keeping it off can lessen the many health risks that come with obesity, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a shorter life. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse. This combination product is not approved for these other uses. Discuss the risks and benefits of this medication, as well as other ways to lose weight, with your doctor.</td><td>0</td><td>B</td><td>Y</td><td>6498.0</td><td>Anti-Obesity-Opioid Antag/Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibit</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2019.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>65757030202</td><td>VIVITROL</td><td>NALTREXONE MICROSPHERES</td><td>380 MG</td><td>SUSPENSION, EXTENDED RELEASE, RECON (EA)</td><td>INTRAMUSC</td><td>99.0</td><td>87.0</td><td>F</td><td>ALKERMES INC</td><td>USES:  This medication is used to treat alcohol abuse.

It is used by certain overweight people, such as those who are obese or have weight-related medical problems. Losing weight and keeping it off can lessen the many health risks that come with obesity, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a shorter life. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse. This combination product is not approved for these other uses. Discuss the risks and benefits of this medication, as well as other ways to lose weight, with your doctor.</td><td>0</td><td>B</td><td>Y</td><td>6498.0</td><td>Anti-Obesity-Opioid Antag/Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibit</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2018.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>00056008050</td><td>TREXAN</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>50 MG</td><td>TABLET</td><td>ORAL</td><td>9.0</td><td>54.0</td><td>F</td><td>DU PONT PHARMA</td><td>USES:  This medication is used to prevent people who have been addicted to certain drugs (opiates) from taking them again.

It is used by certain overweight people, such as those who are obese or have weight-related medical problems. Losing weight and keeping it off can lessen the many health risks that come with obesity, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a shorter life. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse. This combination product is not approved for these other uses. Discuss the risks and benefits of this medication, as well as other ways to lose weight, with your doctor.</td><td>0</td><td>B</td><td>Y</td><td>6498.0</td><td>Anti-Obesity-Opioid Antag/Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibit</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2018.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>51224020650</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>50 MG</td><td>TABLET</td><td>ORAL</td><td>9.0</td><td>54.0</td><td>F</td><td>TAGI PHARMA</td><td>USES:  This medication is used to prevent people who have been addicted to certain drugs (opiates) from taking them again.

treat alcohol abuse. It is used only in people who have been able to stop drinking for some time before starting treatment with naltrexone. You should not be drinking when you start naltrexone. It can help people drink less alcohol or stop drinking altogether. Naltrexone works in the brain to decrease the desire to drink. It does not work like some other treatments for alcohol abuse (e.g., disulfiram). It will not make you sick when taken with alcohol. This medication is also used to prevent relapse to opioid abuse, after opioid detoxification. It works by blocking the action of opioids. This medication must not be used in people currently taking opiates, including methadone. Doing so can cause sudden withdrawal symptoms. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists. It is used as part of a complete treatment program for alcohol or opioid abuse (e.g., counseling, 12-step program, lifestyle changes).</td><td>0</td><td>B</td><td>Y</td><td>5952.0</td><td>Alcohol Abstinence Therapy - Opioid Receptor Antagonist-Type</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2019.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>63629104701</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>50 MG</td><td>TABLET</td><td>ORAL</td><td>9.0</td><td>54.0</td><td>F</td><td>BRYANT RANCH PR</td><td>USES:  This medication is used to prevent people who have been addicted to certain drugs (opiates) from taking them again.

It is used by certain overweight people, such as those who are obese or have weight-related medical problems. Losing weight and keeping it off can lessen the many health risks that come with obesity, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a shorter life. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse. This combination product is not approved for these other uses. Discuss the risks and benefits of this medication, as well as other ways to lose weight, with your doctor.</td><td>0</td><td>B</td><td>Y</td><td>6498.0</td><td>Anti-Obesity-Opioid Antag/Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibit</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2019.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>50090286600</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>50 MG</td><td>TABLET</td><td>ORAL</td><td>9.0</td><td>54.0</td><td>F</td><td>A-S MEDICATION</td><td>USES:  This medication is used to prevent people who have been addicted to certain drugs (opiates) from taking them again.

It is used by certain overweight people, such as those who are obese or have weight-related medical problems. Losing weight and keeping it off can lessen the many health risks that come with obesity, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a shorter life. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse.

Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse.

Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse.

It is used by certain overweight people, such as those who are obese or have weight-related medical problems. Losing weight and keeping it off can lessen the many health risks that come with obesity, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a shorter life. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse. This combination product is not approved for these other uses. Discuss the risks and benefits of this medication, as well as other ways to lose weight, with your doctor.</td><td>0</td><td>B</td><td>Y</td><td>6498.0</td><td>Anti-Obesity-Opioid Antag/Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibit</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2019.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>65757030202</td><td>VIVITROL</td><td>NALTREXONE MICROSPHERES</td><td>380 MG</td><td>SUSPENSION, EXTENDED RELEASE, RECON (EA)</td><td>INTRAMUSC</td><td>99.0</td><td>87.0</td><td>F</td><td>ALKERMES INC</td><td>USES:  This medication is used to treat alcohol abuse.

It is used by certain overweight people, such as those who are obese or have weight-related medical problems. Losing weight and keeping it off can lessen the many health risks that come with obesity, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a shorter life. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse. This combination product is not approved for these other uses. Discuss the risks and benefits of this medication, as well as other ways to lose weight, with your doctor.</td><td>0</td><td>B</td><td>Y</td><td>6498.0</td><td>Anti-Obesity-Opioid Antag/Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibit</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2018.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>00056008050</td><td>TREXAN</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>50 MG</td><td>TABLET</td><td>ORAL</td><td>9.0</td><td>54.0</td><td>F</td><td>DU PONT PHARMA</td><td>USES:  This medication is used to prevent people who have been addicted to certain drugs (opiates) from taking them again.

It is used by certain overweight people, such as those who are obese or have weight-related medical problems. Losing weight and keeping it off can lessen the many health risks that come with obesity, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a shorter life. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse. This combination product is not approved for these other uses. Discuss the risks and benefits of this medication, as well as other ways to lose weight, with your doctor.</td><td>0</td><td>B</td><td>Y</td><td>6498.0</td><td>Anti-Obesity-Opioid Antag/Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibit</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2018.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>51224020650</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>50 MG</td><td>TABLET</td><td>ORAL</td><td>9.0</td><td>54.0</td><td>F</td><td>TAGI PHARMA</td><td>USES:  This medication is used to prevent people who have been addicted to certain drugs (opiates) from taking them again.

treat alcohol abuse. It is used only in people who have been able to stop drinking for some time before starting treatment with naltrexone. You should not be drinking when you start naltrexone. It can help people drink less alcohol or stop drinking altogether. Naltrexone works in the brain to decrease the desire to drink. It does not work like some other treatments for alcohol abuse (e.g., disulfiram). It will not make you sick when taken with alcohol. This medication is also used to prevent relapse to opioid abuse, after opioid detoxification. It works by blocking the action of opioids. This medication must not be used in people currently taking opiates, including methadone. Doing so can cause sudden withdrawal symptoms. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists. It is used as part of a complete treatment program for alcohol or opioid abuse (e.g., counseling, 12-step program, lifestyle changes).</td><td>0</td><td>B</td><td>Y</td><td>5952.0</td><td>Alcohol Abstinence Therapy - Opioid Receptor Antagonist-Type</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2019.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>63629104701</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>50 MG</td><td>TABLET</td><td>ORAL</td><td>9.0</td><td>54.0</td><td>F</td><td>BRYANT RANCH PR</td><td>USES:  This medication is used to prevent people who have been addicted to certain drugs (opiates) from taking them again.

It is used by certain overweight people, such as those who are obese or have weight-related medical problems. Losing weight and keeping it off can lessen the many health risks that come with obesity, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a shorter life. Naltrexone belongs to a class of drugs known as opiate antagonists, and bupropion is an antidepressant that may help restore the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain. These two medications work together on separate parts of the brain to reduce appetite and how much you eat. Most opiates should not be used for 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone, but some opiate drugs (such as methadone) should not be used for 10 to 14 days before starting naltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Other forms of naltrexone or bupropion are used to treat a variety of conditions including depression, other mental/mood disorders, smoking cessation, addiction to opioid medication, and alcohol abuse. This combination product is not approved for these other uses. Discuss the risks and benefits of this medication, as well as other ways to lose weight, with your doctor.</td><td>0</td><td>B</td><td>Y</td><td>6498.0</td><td>Anti-Obesity-Opioid Antag/Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibit</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2019.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>50090286600</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>NALTREXONE HCL</td><td>50 MG</td><td>TABLET</td><td>ORAL</td><td>9.0</td><td>54.0</td><td>F</td><td>A-S MEDICATION</td><td>USES:  This medication is used to prevent people who have been addicted to certain drugs (opiates) from taking them again.

Promethazine is an antihistamine that relieves watery eyes, itchy eyes/nose/throat, runny nose, and sneezing. Codeine is an opioid cough suppressant (antitussive) that affects a certain part of the brain, reducing the urge to cough.

It is a natural product made from animal thyroid glands (usually a pig's). It replaces or provides more thyroid hormone, which is normally produced by the thyroid gland. Low thyroid hormone levels can occur naturally or when the thyroid gland is injured by radiation/medications or removed by surgery. Having enough thyroid hormone is important for maintaining normal mental and physical activity. In children, having enough thyroid hormone is important for normal mental and physical development. This medication is also used to treat other types of thyroid disorders (such as certain types of goiters, thyroid cancer) and also to test for thyroid function. This medication should not be used to treat infertility unless it is caused by low thyroid hormone levels. Older adults should discuss the risks and benefits of this medication with their doctor or pharmacist.</td><td>0</td><td>O</td><td>Y</td><td>2759.0</td><td>Thyroid Hormones - Animal Source (Porcine)</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2013.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>54868084303</td><td>TRIAMCINOLONE ACETONIDE</td><td>TRIAMCINOLONE ACETONIDE</td><td>0.1 %</td><td>CREAM (GRAM)</td><td>TOPICAL</td><td>86.0</td><td>51.0</td><td>F</td><td>PHYSICIANS TC.</td><td>USES:  This medication is used to treat a variety of skin conditions (e.g., eczema, dermatitis, allergies, rash).

If you have been infected with the flu, this medication may help make your symptoms less severe and shorten the time it will take you to get better. Taking amantadine if you have been or will be exposed to the flu may help to prevent you from getting the flu. This medication is an antiviral that is believed to work by stopping growth of the flu virus. This medication is not a vaccine. To increase the chance that you will not get the flu, it is important to get a flu shot once a year at the beginning of every flu season, if possible. Based on the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US, amantadine should not be used to treat or prevent influenza A because the current influenza A virus in the United States and Canada is resistant to this medication. For more details, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Amantadine is also used to treat Parkinson's disease, as well as side effects caused by drugs (e.g., drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms), chemicals, other medical conditions. In these cases, this medication may help to improve your range of motion and ability to exercise.

Amantadine is also used to treat Parkinson's disease, as well as side effects caused by drugs (e.g., drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms), chemicals, other medical conditions. In these cases, this medication may help to improve your range of motion and ability to exercise. For the treatment of these conditions, amantadine is believed to work by restoring the balance of natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain.</td><td>0</td><td>G</td><td>Y</td><td>2691.0</td><td>Antiparkinson Therapy - Non-ergot Dopamine Agonist Agents</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2013.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>54868080000</td><td>AMANTADINE</td><td>AMANTADINE HCL</td><td>100 MG</td><td>CAPSULE</td><td>ORAL</td><td>29.0</td><td>9.0</td><td>F</td><td>PHYSICIANS TC.</td><td>USES:  Amantadine is used to prevent or treat a certain type of flu (influenza A). If you have been infected with the flu, this medication may help make your symptoms less severe and shorten the time it will take you to get better.

Metformin is a biguanide and works by decreasing the amount of sugar that your liver makes and that your stomach/intestines absorb. Both of these medications work by helping to restore your body's proper response to the insulin you naturally produce. Controlling high blood sugar helps prevent kidney damage, blindness, nerve problems, loss of limbs, and sexual function problems.

It is used by women to help reduce symptoms of menopause (such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness). These symptoms are caused by the body making less estrogen. If you are using this medication to treat symptoms only in and around the vagina, products applied directly inside the vagina should be considered before medications that are taken by mouth, absorbed through the skin, or injected. This medication may also be used by women who are not able to produce enough estrogen (for example, due to hypogonadism, primary ovarian failure). Certain estrogen products may also be used by women after menopause to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis). However, there are other medications (such as raloxifene, bisphosphonates including alendronate) that are also effective in preventing bone loss and may be safer. These medications should be considered for use before estrogen treatment.</td><td>0</td><td>O</td><td>Y</td><td>2752.0</td><td>Estrogens</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2013.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>54868100802</td><td>PROCARDIA XL</td><td>NIFEDIPINE</td><td>60 MG</td><td>TABLET, EXTENDED RELEASE 24 HR</td><td>ORAL</td><td>38.0</td><td>76.0</td><td>F</td><td>PHYSICIANS TC.</td><td>USES:  Nifedipine is used alone or in combination with other drugs to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).

These symptoms include rash, itching, watery eyes, itchy eyes/nose/throat, cough, runny nose, and sneezing. It is also used to prevent and treat nausea, vomiting and dizziness caused by motion sickness. Diphenhydramine can also be used to help you relax and fall asleep. This medication works by blocking a certain natural substance (histamine) that your body makes during an allergic reaction. Its drying effects on such symptoms as watery eyes and runny nose are caused by blocking another natural substance made by your body (acetylcholine). Cough-and-cold products have not been shown to be safe or effective in children younger than 6 years. Therefore, do not use this product to treat cold symptoms in children younger than 6 years unless specifically directed by the doctor. Some products (such as long-acting tablets/capsules) are not recommended for use in children younger than 12 years. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details about using your product safely. These products do not cure or shorten the length of the common cold and may cause serious side effects. To decrease the risk for serious side effects, carefully follow all dosage directions. Do not use this product to make a child sleepy. Do not give other cough-and-cold medication that might contain the same or similar ingredients (see also Drug Interactions section).

This medication can decrease headache, tiredness, nausea, dizziness, and shortness of breath that can occur when you climb quickly to high altitudes (generally above 10,000 feet/3,048 meters). It is particularly useful in situations when you cannot make a slow ascent. The best ways to prevent altitude sickness are climbing slowly, stopping for 24 hours during the climb to allow the body to adjust to the new height, and taking it easy the first 1 to 2 days. This medication is also used with other medications to treat high pressure inside the eye due to certain types of glaucoma. Acetazolamide belongs to a class of drugs known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the production of fluid inside the eye. It is also used to decrease a buildup of body fluids (edema) caused by heart failure or certain medications. Acetazolamide can work less well over time, so it is usually used only for a short period.

Acetazolamide can work less well over time, so it is usually used only for a short period. It has also been used with other medications to treat certain types of seizures (petit mal and unlocalized seizures).</td><td>0</td><td>G</td><td>Y</td><td>249.0</td><td>Diuretic - Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2019.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>54868119503</td><td>ACETAZOLAMIDE</td><td>ACETAZOLAMIDE</td><td>250 MG</td><td>TABLET</td><td>ORAL</td><td>56.0</td><td>79.0</td><td>F</td><td>PHYSICIANS TC.</td><td>USES:  Acetazolamide is used to prevent and reduce the symptoms of altitude sickness. This medication can decrease headache, tiredness, nausea, dizziness, and shortness of breath that can occur when you climb quickly to high altitudes (generally above 10,000 feet/3,048 meters). It is particularly useful in situations when you cannot make a slow ascent. The best ways to prevent altitude sickness are climbing slowly, stopping for 24 hours during the climb to allow the body to adjust to the new height, and taking it easy the first 1 to 2 days. This medication is also used with other medications to treat high pressure inside the eye due to certain types of glaucoma. Acetazolamide belongs to a class of drugs known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the production of fluid inside the eye.

This medication does not cure this condition, but it helps decrease symptoms such as fever, stomach pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. After an attack is treated, sulfasalazine is also used to increase the amount of time between attacks. This medication works by reducing irritation and swelling in the large intestines.

It is particularly useful in situations when you cannot make a slow ascent.

This medication is also used with other medications to treat high pressure inside the eye due to certain types of glaucoma. Acetazolamide belongs to a class of drugs known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the production of fluid inside the eye. It is also used to decrease a buildup of body fluids (edema) caused by heart failure or certain medications. Acetazolamide can work less well over time, so it is usually used only for a short period.

It helps to decrease the amount of HIV in your body so your immune system can work better. This lowers your chance of getting HIV complications (such as new infections, cancer) and improves your quality of life. This product is a combination of two different drugs: emtricitabine and tenofovir. Emtricitabine is called a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, while tenofovir is called a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor. They are often called NRTIs. This product should not be used by itself to help control HIV infection. Doing so can make your treatment less effective. Combination treatment with at least one other HIV medication should be used. This product is also used to help prevent HIV infection in people who have a high risk for infection. Some things that increase risk include having a partner infected with HIV, having unprotected sex, having multiple sex partners, infection with a sexually transmitted disease-STD, or use/abuse of drugs or alcohol. Emtricitabine/tenofovir is not a cure for HIV infection. To decrease your risk of spreading HIV disease to others, continue to take all HIV medications exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Use an effective barrier method (latex or polyurethane condoms/dental dams) during sexual activity as directed by your doctor. Do not share personal items (such as needles/syringes, toothbrushes, and razors) that may have contacted blood or other body fluids.

Normally, the amount of urine you make is controlled by a certain substance in the body called vasopressin. In people who have \"water diabetes\" (diabetes insipidus) or certain kinds of head injury or brain surgery, the body does not make enough vasopressin. Desmopressin is a man-made form of vasopressin and is used to replace a low level of vasopressin.

This medication is an emergency contraceptive and should not be used as a regular form of birth control. It is a progestin hormone that works mainly by preventing the release of an egg (ovulation) during your menstrual cycle. It also makes vaginal fluid thicker to help prevent sperm from reaching an egg (fertilization) and changes the lining of the uterus (womb) to prevent attachment of a fertilized egg. Using this medication will not stop an existing pregnancy or protect you or your partner against sexually transmitted diseases (such as HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia). This medication may not work well in women over a certain weight (for example, greater than 164 pounds or 74 kilograms), or if you have used certain other medications within the past month. This effect can result in pregnancy. Talk to your doctor for more details and to see if this medication is right for you (see also Drug Interactions section). Check the ingredients on the label even if you have used the product before. The manufacturer may have changed the ingredients. Also, products with similar names may contain different ingredients meant for different purposes.

It contains 2 hormones: a progestin and an estrogen. It works mainly by preventing the release of an egg (ovulation) during your menstrual cycle. It also makes vaginal fluid thicker to help prevent sperm from reaching an egg (fertilization) and changes the lining of the uterus (womb) to prevent attachment of a fertilized egg. If a fertilized egg does not attach to the uterus, it passes out of the body.

These symptoms include rash, itching, watery eyes, itchy eyes/nose/throat, cough, runny nose, and sneezing. It is also used to prevent and treat nausea, vomiting and dizziness caused by motion sickness. Diphenhydramine can also be used to help you relax and fall asleep. This medication works by blocking a certain natural substance (histamine) that your body makes during an allergic reaction. Its drying effects on such symptoms as watery eyes and runny nose are caused by blocking another natural substance made by your body (acetylcholine). Cough-and-cold products have not been shown to be safe or effective in children younger than 6 years. Therefore, do not use this product to treat cold symptoms in children younger than 6 years unless specifically directed by the doctor. Some products (such as long-acting tablets/capsules) are not recommended for use in children younger than 12 years. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details about using your product safely. These products do not cure or shorten the length of the common cold and may cause serious side effects. To decrease the risk for serious side effects, carefully follow all dosage directions. Do not use this product to make a child sleepy. Do not give other cough-and-cold medication that might contain the same or similar ingredients (see also Drug Interactions section).

It is particularly useful in situations when you cannot make a slow ascent. The best ways to prevent altitude sickness are climbing slowly, stopping for 24 hours during the climb to allow the body to adjust to the new height, and taking it easy the first 1 to 2 days. This medication is also used with other medications to treat high pressure inside the eye due to certain types of glaucoma. Acetazolamide belongs to a class of drugs known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the production of fluid inside the eye. It is also used to decrease a buildup of body fluids (edema) caused by heart failure or certain medications. Acetazolamide can work less well over time, so it is usually used only for a short period.

For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, penicillamine is known as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). It helps to decrease pain/tenderness/swelling in the joints. For the treatment of Wilson's disease, penicillamine binds to copper and helps it to be removed from the body. Decreasing copper levels helps to improve liver function and the mental/mood/nerve problems (such as confusion, difficulty speaking/walking) caused by the disease. For the treatment of cystinuria, penicillamine helps to decrease the amount of a certain substance (cystine) in the urine which can cause kidney stones.</td><td>0</td><td>G</td><td>Y</td><td>6137.0</td><td>Chelating Agents - Copper</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2019.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>70748013306</td><td>SILDENAFIL CITRATE</td><td>SILDENAFIL CITRATE</td><td>100 MG</td><td>TABLET</td><td>ORAL</td><td>99.0</td><td>99.0</td><td>F</td><td>LUPIN PHARMACEU</td><td>USES:  Sildenafil is used to treat male sexual function problems (impotence or erectile dysfunction-ED).

This medication can decrease headache, tiredness, nausea, dizziness, and shortness of breath that can occur when you climb quickly to high altitudes (generally above 10,000 feet/3,048 meters). It is particularly useful in situations when you cannot make a slow ascent. The best ways to prevent altitude sickness are climbing slowly, stopping for 24 hours during the climb to allow the body to adjust to the new height, and taking it easy the first 1 to 2 days. This medication is also used with other medications to treat high pressure inside the eye due to certain types of glaucoma. Acetazolamide belongs to a class of drugs known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the production of fluid inside the eye. It is also used to decrease a buildup of body fluids (edema) caused by heart failure or certain medications. Acetazolamide can work less well over time, so it is usually used only for a short period. It has also been used with other medications to treat certain types of seizures (petit mal and unlocalized seizures).</td><td>0</td><td>G</td><td>Y</td><td>249.0</td><td>Diuretic - Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2019.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>70710155001</td><td>RANITIDINE HCL</td><td>RANITIDINE HCL</td><td>25 MG/ML</td><td>VIAL (ML)</td><td>INJECTION</td><td>65.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>F</td><td>ZYDUS PHARMACEU</td><td>USES:  Ranitidine is used to treat ulcers of the stomach and intestines and prevent them from coming back after they have healed. This medication is also used to treat certain stomach and throat (esophagus) problems (such as erosive esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease-GERD, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). It works by decreasing the amount of acid your stomach makes. It relieves symptoms such as cough that doesn't go away, stomach pain, heartburn, and difficulty swallowing. Ranitidine belongs to a class of drugs known as H2 blockers. This form of ranitidine is given by injection and is used for short-term treatment of these conditions when you cannot take this medication by mouth. Your doctor should switch you to taking this medication by mouth when possible. This drug has been withdrawn from the US market due to problems with safety. A possible cancer-causing impurity has been found in some ranitidine products.</td><td>0</td><td>G</td><td>Y</td><td>443.0</td><td>Gastric Acid Secretion Reducers - Histamine H2-Receptor Antagonists</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2020.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>70710153406</td><td>CISATRACURIUM BESYLATE</td><td>CISATRACURIUM BESYLATE</td><td>10 MG/ML</td><td>VIAL (ML)</td><td>INTRAVEN</td><td>32.0</td><td>8.0</td><td>F</td><td>ZYDUS PHARMACEU</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>G</td><td>Y</td><td>645.0</td><td>Neuromuscular Blocker - Nondepolarizing Agents</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2020.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>70710153401</td><td>CISATRACURIUM BESYLATE</td><td>CISATRACURIUM BESYLATE</td><td>10 MG/ML</td><td>VIAL (ML)</td><td>INTRAVEN</td><td>32.0</td><td>8.0</td><td>F</td><td>ZYDUS PHARMACEU</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>G</td><td>Y</td><td>645.0</td><td>Neuromuscular Blocker - Nondepolarizing Agents</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2020.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>70710153101</td><td>DOXORUBICIN HCL LIPOSOME</td><td>DOXORUBICIN HCL PEG-LIPOSOMAL</td><td>2 MG/ML</td><td>VIAL (ML)</td><td>INTRAVEN</td><td>26.0</td><td>30.0</td><td>F</td><td>ZYDUS PHARMACEU</td><td>USES:  Liposomal doxorubicin is an anthracycline-type chemotherapy drug that is used to treat certain types of cancer (e.g., ovarian cancer, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, multiple myeloma).

It helps to decrease the amount of HIV in your body so your immune system can work better. This lowers your chance of getting HIV complications (such as new infections, cancer) and improves your quality of life. This product is a combination of two different drugs: emtricitabine and tenofovir. Emtricitabine is called a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, while tenofovir is called a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor. They are often called NRTIs. This product should not be used by itself to help control HIV infection. Doing so can make your treatment less effective. Combination treatment with at least one other HIV medication should be used. This product is also used to help prevent HIV infection in people who have a high risk for infection. Some things that increase risk include having a partner infected with HIV, having unprotected sex, having multiple sex partners, infection with a sexually transmitted disease-STD, or use/abuse of drugs or alcohol. Emtricitabine/tenofovir is not a cure for HIV infection. To decrease your risk of spreading HIV disease to others, continue to take all HIV medications exactly as prescribed by your doctor.

Usually gout symptoms develop suddenly and involve only one or a few joints. The big toe, knee, or ankle joints are most often affected. Gout is caused by too much uric acid in the blood. When uric acid levels in the blood are too high, the uric acid may form hard crystals in your joints. Colchicine works by decreasing swelling and lessening the build up of uric acid crystals that cause pain in the affected joint(s). This medication is also used to prevent attacks of pain in the abdomen, chest, or joints caused by a certain inherited disease (familial Mediterranean fever). It is thought to work by decreasing your body's production of a certain protein (amyloid A) that builds up in people with familial Mediterranean fever.

Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems. This product contains 2 medications: atenolol and chlorthalidone. Atenolol belongs to a class of drugs known as beta blockers. It works by blocking the action of certain natural chemicals in your body, such as epinephrine, on the heart and blood vessels. This effect lowers the heart rate, blood pressure, and strain on the heart. Chlorthalidone is a \"water pill\" (diuretic) and causes your body to get rid of extra salt and water. This effect may increase the amount of urine you make when you first start the medication. It also helps to relax the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily. These medications are used together when 1 drug alone is not controlling your blood pressure. Your doctor may direct you to start taking the individual medications first, and then switch you over to this combination product if this is the best dose combination for you.</td><td>0</td><td>G</td><td>Y</td><td>2730.0</td><td>Cardiac Selective Beta Blocker-Thiazide Diuretic and Related Comb.</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>2019.0</td><td>2020.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>70710116701</td><td>ATENOLOL-CHLORTHALIDONE</td><td>ATENOLOL/CHLORTHALIDONE</td><td>50 MG-25MG</td><td>TABLET</td><td>ORAL</td><td>41.0</td><td>76.0</td><td>F</td><td>ZYDUS PHARMACEU</td><td>USES:  This medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).

It works by increasing the natural substance (enzyme) that breaks down fats in the blood. Fenofibrate belongs to a group of drugs known as \"fibrates.\" Lowering triglycerides in people with very high triglyceride blood levels may decrease the risk of pancreas disease (pancreatitis).
